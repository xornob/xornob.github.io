      <p>I feel that the biggest problem that India faces is overpopulation. I feel this way for 5 reasons:</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>Poverty stems from overpopulation.</li>
      	<li>If the population continues to rise, India will have to import food and other commodities until it is in debt.</li>
      	<li>India will also have to export waste.</li>
      	<li>Poverty can be solved easily with outside help, but overpopulation requires emigration or death.</li>
      	<li>Kashmir can be a rallying point for the people to bring them out of poverty, similar to WWII for the US.</li>
      </ol>
